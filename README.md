# Dotfiles
These are my configurations for Hyprland and Wofi.

### Notes
For Hyprland, I made a seperate binds config for better readability.

### Acknowledgments 
* The waybar files were referenced from this user's dotfiles:
  sameemul-haque - https://github.com/sameemul-haque

* I sourced the wofi design from images I've seen online.
All thanks to those who share their creativity with others.
