# Dotfiles
These are my configurations for Hyprland and Wofi.

### Installation
Running the install script will move files into your ~/.config directory.
If those files exist you will be prompted to overwrite them.
```sh
sh install.sh
```

### Notes
For Hyprland, I made a seperate binds config for better readability.

### Acknowledgments
I sourced the wofi design from images I've seen online.
All thanks to those who share their creativity with others.
